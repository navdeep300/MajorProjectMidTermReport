\section{Overview}
\noindent Automated Building Drawing is a project for creating two-dimensional drawings (front-view, top-view, side-view etc.) from a three-dimensional model.

\noindent The main purpose or objective of the project is to make it usable even by the layman. The main target users are the Civil Engineers who want their plans to be printed on the sheets. As of now, they have to create the drawings separately with different views in any CAD software and the 3D model separately. So to automate converting a particular three-dimensional model to the print-ready drawings (with different views), this project will be beneficial. The interface should be easy to use and pretty intuitive. Because the interface is a thing that makes user experience better and to make the user use it.

\noindent The Drawing module allows you to put your 3D work on paper. That is, to put views of your models in a 2D window and to insert that window in a drawing, for example a sheet with a border, a title and your logo and finally print that sheet. The drawing may consist of different views like top, front, side and orthographic views.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item To put views of your models in a 2D window and to insert that window in a drawing,.
\item Automatically creates orthographic views of an object.
\end{itemize}
